# Benchmark tests

Tests to compare Euler to other models. Please note that for VGRNN, VGAE, and DynGraph2Vec models, we use the scores reported in the VGRNN paper. 

To run, simply run either `euler_test.py` or `egcn_test.py`. 

Note: for these experiments, the data sets are small, so we use a non-distributed version of Euler.
